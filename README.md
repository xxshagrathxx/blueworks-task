# blueworks-task
About the Project you can deploy and create database with seeder by: php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
About the tasks all are included in api routes to Api TaskController, the first task i made the logic function, the second task is finished, the third task i did not understand what is required, this is about the first part
The second part a made a proto type but i didn't check any validations nor it's the best performance, but as a task it's working fine.
